# Natural Language Processing ##

This repo consists of projects taken up outside of any coursework or learning path with focus on application of learned methodologies under Natural Language Processing.  
  
## BERT-FAQ-Bot :   
- Created for reducing the Turn Around Time of organisation's inbound queries from customers as well as prospects.  
- Uses bert-base-uncased model , pretrained on the SQAD dataset, curated by Stanforfd and annotated Mechanical Turks.
- Returns answers with reference to information provided as context.

  
## NLP on Real Data :  
- An intensive text analytics project serving as framework for any similar project.  
- Collection of data using web-scraping, from a large number of blog sites and storing it locally.  
- Performing text cleaning and preprocessing on it to make it code-ready and workable.
- Conducting text mining, topic modelling, word cloud generation and sentiment scoring to derive insights from the data.

  
## BERT-Sentiment Analyser :  
- Fine-tuning the BERT-base-uncased model to work for a reviews dataset.  
- Using InputExample method to feed train_data and SparseCategoricalCrossEntropy as loss function(used when mutually exclusive classification).  
- Achieving high reduction of losses within 2 epochs and succesfully classifying even closely similar reviews.
